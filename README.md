# Contentful API

A partial SDK that lets you easily interact with the Contentful Delivery (or Preview) API in a strongly-typed environment. 

> Note: While not complete, most use cases should be handled with the current implementation. Feel free to open an issue if you have another use case I haven't covered, and I'd be happy to take a look and expand the library!

## Installation

```shell
# npm
npm install @brr-dev/contentful

# yarn
yarn add @brr-dev/contentful
```

## Usage
